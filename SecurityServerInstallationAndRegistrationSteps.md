# Straumurinn - Security Server installation and registration steps

## Security Server installation and registration steps

### Hardware requirements

* 64-bit dual-core Intel, AMD or compatible CPU; AES instruction set support is highly recommended
* 2 CPU
* 4 GB RAM
* 10 GB free disk space \(OS partition\) and 20-40 GB free disk space on the “/var” partition
* 100 Mbps network interface card 

### Operating System, choice of either

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 \(RHEL7\) or newer.
* Ubuntu 18.04 Long-Term Support \(LTS\).
* Ubuntu 20.04 Long-Term Support \(LTS\). 

### Network configuration

The X-Road Security Servers mediate service calls and service responses between Information Systems. They can be placed in a DMZ between the Information Systems they serve and the Internet. Port openings can be configured like so:

* **External network:**
  * Inbound: TCP 5500  TCP 5577 
  * Outbound: TCP 5500 TCP 5577 TCP 4001 TCP 80 TCP 443
* **Internal network:**
  * Inbound and outbound: TCP 4000 TCP 80 TCP 443 
* On a RedHat 7 / CentOS 7 or Ubuntu 18.04 LTS machine, consult the X-Road Knowledge Base how-to article [How to Set Up a Security Server?](https://confluence.niis.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=4292920) while taking care to override the official documentation with specific steps for the Icelandic environment \(_Straumurinn_\), outlined at: [https://github.com/digitaliceland/Straumurinn](https://github.com/digitaliceland/Straumurinn#getting-started-installing-security-server-and-intial-configuration)
* Add OS user to run the X-Road server: `sudo useradd --system --home /var/lib/xroad --no-create-home --shell /bin/bash --user-group --comment "X-Road system user" xroad`  If that user will be used for interactive SSH log-ins, then so the Security Server PIN won't be cleared \(even though auto-login is configured\), the following command can be entered: `loginctl enable-linger xroad` 
* During installation, dialog will appear asking for host and IP information for certificate generation. The latter set of the dialog will be for configuring certificates for the xroad-proxy-ui-api. Here it may be desirable to change the value from the auto-detected machine host name to a domain name used for accessing the Admin UI:

* Once a Security Server has been successfully installed, the Admin UI can be opened in a web browser at [https://SECURITYSERVER:4000/](https://securityserver:4000/) . After logging in with the user credentials declared during the installation process, a prompt for importing a Configuration Anchor is displayed. The configuration anchors for each environment \(IS-DEV, IS-TEST, IS\) are linked to at: [https://github.com/digitaliceland/Straumurinn\#getting-started-installing-security-server-and-intial-configuration](https://github.com/digitaliceland/Straumurinn#getting-started-installing-security-server-and-intial-configuration)
* Before being able to import a Configuration Anchor, the Security Server IP and FQDN must be whitelisted by the operator of the _Straumurinn_ X-Road central services. To start the _Straumurinn_ application process, the information \(IP, FQDN and the organization’s SSN \(should be obtained from the organization contact\)\) should be sent to [hjalp@ok.is](mailto:hjalp@ok.is)

The public IP address of requests originating within the server can be found with with the following command

```text
curl ifconfig.me
```

### Registration Email for Security Server to Central \(example\)

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%285%29.png)

### After the server has been registered in Central 

* During a [Security Server initial configuration](https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/doc/Manuals/ig-ss_x-road_v6_security_server_installation_guide.md#3-security-server-initial-configuration), a PIN is required to be set, which should be a 12 digit, alpha-numeric password: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal\_identification\_number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_identification_number) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_9564\#PIN\_length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9564#PIN_length)
* Disable message payload logging \(for now, due to GDPR\).

  The xroad-securityserver-is variant has the message logging disabled by default, from X-Road version 6.24.0 onwards.  

* For PIN to be entered automatically when starting X-Road services, follow this guide: [https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/doc/Manuals/Utils/ug-autologin\_x-road\_v6\_autologin\_user\_guide.md](https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/doc/Manuals/Utils/ug-autologin_x-road_v6_autologin_user_guide.md)
* Starting and stopping X-Road services to test the PIN entry functionality:

```python
for i in xroad-confclient xroad-proxy xroad-signer xroad-monitor xroad-opmonitor xroad-proxy-ui-api ;do echo "stopping $i"; sudo service $i stop;done
sudo systemctl list-units "xroad*"
for i in xroad-confclient xroad-proxy xroad-signer xroad-monitor xroad-opmonitor xroad-proxy-ui-api ;do echo "starting $i"; sudo service $i start;done
```

* Check if all services are up and running

```bash
sudo systemctl list-units "xroad*"
```

* Enable health check endpoint: [https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/doc/Manuals/LoadBalancing/ig-xlb\_x-road\_external\_load\_balancer\_installation\_guide.md\#34-health-check-service-configuration](https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/doc/Manuals/LoadBalancing/ig-xlb_x-road_external_load_balancer_installation_guide.md#34-health-check-service-configuration)

### Generate CSR certificates and import Anchors

![](.gitbook/assets/4%20%281%29.png)

In the next screen a configuration anchor is requested. Upload the configuration anchor from the central server.

![](.gitbook/assets/5.png)

Press UPLOAD to upload the anchor

![](.gitbook/assets/6.png)

After anchor has been uploaded needs to be confirmed.

Check that the "Hash Generated" corresponds to the information on the Central Server.

Press CONFIRM.

![](.gitbook/assets/7.png)

In the initial configuration screen input the values as follows.

* Member Class - the Member Class of the organization that maintains the central server.
* Member Code - the Member Code of the organization that maintains the central server.
* Member Name - is auto completed when Member Code is added.
* Security Server Code - unique code identifying the Security Server.
  * Use short-name for Server Code
  * Do not use FQDN, ".", "/" or "\".
    * Some extensions use dots as separators, e.g. REST Adapter Service.
  * X-Road Message Protocol imposes some restrictions on the characters that can be used in X-Road identifiers. The following characters SHALL NOT be used in the identifier values:
    * Colon
    * Semicolon
    * Slash
    * Backslash
    * Percent
    * Path identifiers \(such as /../\)
    * Non-printable characters \(tab, newline etc.\)

* PIN - the password that protects the security server's secret keys.
* Repeat PIN - repeat the above PIN.
* Press SUBMIT.
